---@class Container
---@field client Client # A shortcut to the client object to which this container is visible.
---@field parent Container|Client # The parent object of to which this container is a child. For example, the parent of a role is the guild in which the role exists.
---@overload fun(): Container
local Container = {}

---
---@return boolean
function Container:__eq() end

---
