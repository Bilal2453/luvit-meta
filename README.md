# Luvit-Meta

This project is a collection of definition files for the framework [Luvit](https://github.com/Luvit/Luvit). The definitions provide types for all modules currently shipped in Luvit, the classes, methods and their arguments and returns; it does as well provide descriptions whereever possible, either by scraping the Luvit-docs, Nodejs docs, luv docs or manually written in some places.

Some of the definitions are scraped off of code/docs and then some manual work is done to figure types out. For those the used scraper is located under [scrapers](/scrapers), the script outputs to a file in the same directory. From there it is manually copied over to the actual library definition.
Other definitions -and most of them- are completely manually written, as it was required to figure the logic out in order to figure the types.

### Cool, any examples?

Here are some samples of it working:

### Where does this work?

The definitions use the [Sumneko's Lua Language Server (LLS)](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/) annotations, therefor it should work on any editor that support LLS, such as [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) and Neovim.

### How to install it?

#### On Visual Studio Code:

  1. Install [this plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) then reload editor.
    
  2. Open the workspace you want to enable this in.
  3. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, a prompt will open.
  4. Type "Open addon manager" and press enter.

  5. Search for `Luvit` then press `Enable`.

  6. The definitions should now be enabled for that workspace.
     Typing something like `local fs = require'fs'` will show you auto-completion.


#### Manually, for other editors:

  1. Install [LLS]((https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/)) for your editor.
  2. Configure your meta directory.
  3. [Click here](https://github.com/Bilal2453/luvit-meta/archive/refs/heads/release.zip) to download the definitions; alternatively clone this repository.
  4. Extract the ZIP file to your meta directory/move the folder there.
  5. Should now be ready. If not, check the editor plugin's manual for doing this.
